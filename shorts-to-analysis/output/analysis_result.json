    "description": "The video opens with a mirrored image of a woman at an indoor shooting range, wearing ear protection and holding a pistol. This transitions to an outdoor scene where a child, wearing an orange hat and overalls, lies prone and aims a large sniper rifle, accompanied by the text \"OTHER PEOPLE SHOOTING\". The next shot shows a man with dreadlocks and headphones standing in a grassy field, holding and aiming a pump-action shotgun, also with the text \"OTHER PEOPLE SHOOTING\" overlaid. The final scene features a man standing in a rugged, desert-like landscape, holding an extremely large, long-barreled sniper rifle, with text appearing that reads \"THIS GUY...\" and \"NO WAY...\", along with a crowned skull emoji. A \"Xurnex2\" watermark is visible throughout the video.",
