However, if the beam sticks out too much, it bends easily. So you support it with a slanted beam underneath. To make the house wider, you increase the distance between columns, but that makes the horizontal beams longer and weaker. Again, you can use slanted supports, but they take up space and make the room less useful. Then you think of another idea. Carve the column lower and fit in a cross-shaped base for extra support. Add a beam on top, and now you can build longer spans. But since too much wood was cut from the top, it's not sturdy enough.

Later, a specialist arrived and found cat droppings, proving the kitten was still trapped somewhere nearby. That night, rescuers returned with better tools, determined not to give up. After hours of searching, they finally discovered the kitten was stuck deep inside a narrow pillar connecting the inside and outside of the building. They lowered a camera and saw him, weak, scared, and trying to climb toward the light but slipping every time. The next morning, the rescue began. Carefully, they opened the base of the pillar, suddenly, a small paw reached out for help. When they cleared the last bit of debris, his tiny head popped through, and the vet gently pulled him free. Everyone cheered. The kitten was dangerously thin, barely two months old, but now safe, warm, and loved at last.", "keyframes": ["output/keyframes/4PzFXvj3H9Y_frame_000.jpg", "output/keyframes/4PzFXvj3H9Y_frame_001.jpg", "output/keyframes/4PzFXvj3H9Y_frame_002.jpg", "output/keyframes/4PzFXvj3H9Y_frame_003.jpg"]}

You cover your windscreen in laundry detergent. If anything, you've just made your driving less safe because you can't see out the windscreen anymore. I'm legally blind. I keep a mannequin on the passenger seat, so it looks like there's a man in the car. No, that just looks like there's a mannequin in the car. And do you know why? Because there is. I always carry a small alarm as well as pepper spray. I wonder if they work against the police. I put masculine stickers on my car to prevent people from interacting with me. Oh yeah, cuz a common trait of masculinity is just to go ghost and not speak to anyone. I also have a teddy bear in the backseat. It has a camera so it can record any situation that may arise. I'm sure I've seen this in Black Mirror. Also, unless the bear's strapped in with a seat belt, it's going to fall over surely and then you haven't got any footage. Why don't you just put a camera in the corner of the car? When I'm at a gas station, I put on oversized jeans, a shirt, and a man mask. That's not a man mask, that's like a goblin. What is that? Don't tell me you go to petrol stations wearing that. This is usually the most dangerous. She goes to petrol stations wearing that. Look at this fit right now. I feel like you're drawing more attention to yourself. location for us women. So I dress like a man and I make What on earth are we actually doing here? sure to take extra precaution and stay vigilant. No, I think I would be staying vigilant after seeing that. Not you. When I park my car to run any other errands, I put cones around my car. Okay, now that one, that one's not actually a bad idea. I'll be honest. Unless someone thinks that your car is dodgy and it gets towed. And I pour a foul smelling liquid around my car that deters people from going near it. No, that's just bizarre. Whenever I see someone Don't tell me that's an Aztec death whistle. I blow an Aztec death whistle. Oh, for God's sake. to keep them away. Oh my God. I hate those things. I always make sure to stay on the phone with family members whenever I drive. Yeah, cuz that's not illegal, is it? And I keep a GPS tracker on my car so they know my location at all times. So once again, that's not a bad idea. Why have we got some moments of genius, mixed with some moments of absolute I know all of this seems a bit excessive, but there's a lot of crazy people out there.
