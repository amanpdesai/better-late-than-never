Abruptly, a large, rectangular section of the sidewalk collapses, creating a deep hole directly in front of the child and to the side of the dog, adjacent to a storm drain. The child, dog, and adults remain in place, with the newly formed pit separating the child from the others."

Finally, the man reappears, now with full clown makeup, including white face paint, exaggerated eyebrows, a red nose, and a painted frown with a blue tear drop. He maintains a somber yet slightly unsettling expression, his fists still clenched."

In the next scene, a piece of paper is shown with the word 'CAPS' written in large letters at the top. Below this, five fingerprint characters are depicted with drawn faces and stick arms and legs, each representing a different person. Strands of hair are attached to the top of each fingerprint to represent their hair. The names 'Gi', 'Mily', 'Su', 'Mei', and 'Ana' are written below their respective fingerprint characters. Smaller red heart shapes are scattered around the paper, and text at the bottom reads 'Colecionando momentos' with a red heart emoji."

In the initial scene, a man dressed in a white t-shirt and black shorts is captured leaning forward on the boat's deck, his hands placed on a wooden surface, gazing intently towards the churning water. The boat is actively moving, generating a significant white wake behind it on the deep blue sea, under a sky dotted with clouds. The subsequent scene features a different man, attired in a black hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans, who is shown firmly grasping a thick rope that is wrapped around a prominent yellow mooring post. Behind him, another individual in a bright yellow t-shirt stands by the railing, observing the tranquil blue water and a visible pier in the distance, suggesting the boat is either approaching a dock or has just docked."

He successfully inserts the pod into the opened latch and pushes it down, causing the red liquid concentrate to mix into the water.
